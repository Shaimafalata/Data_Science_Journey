Good evening, my name is Shaima. I created this Github account to keep track of my progress in learning tech skills. Specifically, my journey in both **data science** and **data analytics**. This very repo will be dedicated to recording what i have learned. The repo will contain topics like:

- Data Visualization
- Data Exploration
- Machine Learning. Etc. 


Come with me as i explore the amazing world of data. As they say *Data is the new OIL*.
